Years ago, when Matus was backpacking across Western Europe,
He was just outside of Barcelona, hiking in the foothills of mount Tibidabo.
He was at the end of this path, and he came to a clearing, and there was a lake.
Very secluded and there were tall trees all around.
It was dead silent, Gorgeous. And across the lake he saw a beautiful woman bathing herself.
And it was Bea, but she was crying....
